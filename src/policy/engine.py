"""
Policy / Clearance Engine — deterministic rule evaluation.

Receives a structured Action and a loaded ContextSnapshot, applies an ordered
set of named rules, and returns a PolicyResult.

Design contract
---------------
- The model interprets intent; this engine decides whether money moves.
- Rules are evaluated in a fixed order; the first failure short-circuits.
- Every rule that is *checked* is recorded in PolicyResult.evaluated_rules
  so the audit trail shows exactly which rules ran, not just the outcome.
- No Hedera dependencies. No LLM logic. Pure Python + Pydantic.

Rule catalogue (MVP)
--------------------
  R001  RECIPIENT_PRESENT     deny  if recipient_id is blank (transfer/payout)
  R002  AMOUNT_VALID          deny  if amount_hbar is missing or <= 0
  R003  ACTOR_AUTHORISED      deny  if actor role is not in the permitted set
  R004  TREASURY_NOT_FROZEN   deny  if treasury posture is FROZEN
  R005  RECIPIENT_APPROVED    deny  if recipient is not on actor's approved list
                                    (skipped when the approved list is empty —
                                     empty list means "open access" for that actor)
  R006  AMOUNT_WITHIN_LIMIT   APPROVAL_REQUIRED if amount exceeds actor threshold
  R007  TREASURY_NOT_RESTRICTED  MANUAL_REVIEW if treasury posture is RESTRICTED

Adding a new rule
-----------------
1. Define a _RuleID constant string.
2. Write a private _check_<name>() function — signature: (Action, ContextSnapshot)
   -> PolicyResult | None.  Return None if the rule passes.
3. Append it to _RULES in order.
